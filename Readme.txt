This is the Readme file for the project and executing the code.
REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Python 2.7
  2. opencv
  3. PIL
  4. matplotlib
  5. numpy

  STEPS:
    1. After installing the requirements, you can execute the code either using a terminal or by just opening the main.py file provided with this file.
    2. This main.py file contains the exact code used to generate the output.
    3. The testimages have been placed inside the Test_images directory.
    4. For running the code with the test images, just shift the test images from the Test_images directory to the directory where the main.py file has been placed and the images will appear on the trackbar.
    5. For closing the execution, just press `Esc` on the trackbar window.
    
    NOTE: While shifting from one image to another, make sure that you first close the plot generated. The images that pop up during execution can be left open.
